## Chrome Cast

If you have the infrastructure for it, it is quite easy to display the score of a match being reffed with the app on a big screen

What is needed:
* a TV with a [ChromeCast](https://www.google.com/chromecast "ChromeCast") device attached to it
* ensure both the ChromeCast and the device with Squore on it, are connected to the same WIFI network

If both conditions above are met, Squore will automatically detect the 'presence' of (one or more) ChromeCast devices and 
the 'Cast' button will become visible in the action bar.

If you press it, you will be presented with the option to select the ChromeCast device
on which you want to display the score.

In the picture above the ChromeCast devices themselves are conveniently called _Court 1_ and _Court 2_.

After choosing the appropriate ChromeCast device, Squore should appear on the TV with the device.
All elements displayed on the device that have no use on the ChromeCast device are not displayed on the TV (floating buttons for _New match_, _Announcement_, _Toss_, _Timer_)

During the pause between games, the ChromeCast device will show 
* the game scores of all games already played
* the scoring of the last game in a graph
* the 'Pause' countdown timer

If this is not desired, you can disable this in the _Live Score + ChromeCast_ section of _Settings_.

### Be aware

Best practice for casting would probably be to have a WIFI network to which access is limited. 
If you use e.g. a venue-wide public WIFI network, everybody connected to that network can see the Cast devices and e.g. start casting YouTube films on it...
