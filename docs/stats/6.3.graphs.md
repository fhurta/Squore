## Score history/detail/graphs

The end score of previous games is shown in a small box between the player names.
If you want to know more detail about the previous games, click on this small area.

A new swipable window will popup, where you can consult
* the score history in the form of a line graph (for each game of the match).
* the complete scoring history (including game duration of the games for those who find that interesting).
* an overview of all appeals/conducts and decisions you took (provided of course you entered them in the app during the game) <!-- Squore only -->

![Squore History Sheet"](/img/sb.scoredetails.03.scorehistory.png)

You can configure Squore to automatically show these details as soon as a game ends under 'Settings/Behaviour'.
