## Club and countries

Besides specifying the name of a player, you can also specify 
- the club a player is playing for and/or 
- a country for the player 

### Clubs

You can manually enter the name of the club.

The club name as such will not be displayed on screen by default if you also entered the players name.
In stead Squore will display an abbreviation of your clubs name between brackets.

Squore will try to deduce an abbreviation (max 4 letters) for the club names you entered.

Examples:
- 'Squash 22' will become S22
- 'Double Yellow Squash' will become DYS
- 'Symbio' will become SYMB

If you do not like the abbreviation Squore 'calculates', you can control the abbreviation by entering it between brackets:

E.g.
- Squash 22 [SQ22]
- Double Yellow [DBY]

Each club name you have entered before will be suggested to you automatically the next time you enter club names.
The appropriate names will be suggested to you after you have typed the first few characters.

### Countries

You can specify countries by starting to type the name of the country.
After a few characters Squore will suggest matching countries to you for easy selection.

The nice thing about specifying the country is that Squore will download the matching 
flag from the squore server. The flag will then be displayed on the deviced and/or 
on the ChromeCast device (if you are using that functionality).

If you know you are going somewhere to ref where there will be no or very bad internet connection
it might be wise to 'prefetch' all flags while you do have a good internet connection.
You can do this via `Settings/Internet/Prefetch Flag images`.

### Good to know

If you specify the club name first, the player name field will be prefilled with the club name.
If you specify the country first, the player name field will be prefilled with the name of the country.
