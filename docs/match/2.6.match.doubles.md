## Doubles match

Besides specifying the names of players as with singles matches, here you can also select the
way 'who serves next' is determined.

The following _sequences_ are supported:
* A2/B1/B2 then A1/A2/B1/B2
* A1/B1/B2 then A1/A2/B1/B2
* A1/A2/B1/B2       
* A1/B1/A1/B1       
* A1/B1/A2/B2
